Na :numref:`figure-spacesuit-a7l-boots` the so-called * Lunar Overshoe *, i.e. the part that is put on the sock, which is an integral part of the suit. With the exception of * ribbed silicone rubber sole *, the outer part of the shoe was made of metal-reinforced * Chromel R * (metal-woven fabric *) fabric. The use of such technology was to protect against abrasion. The inner part of the shoe was made of a canvas covered with a Teflon layer of fiberglass (* Teflon-coated fiber-glass *). The use of 25 overlapping layers of Kapton and glass fiber was intended to increase strength, reduce weight and provide thermal insulation. The shoes were manufactured by General Electric and ILC Industries Inc.

In the current * EMU * and * Orlan * suits, the boots are not reinforced in this way. Astronauts do not use legs during spacewalks in the construction of the ISS, and this part of the suit is less complicated.

        - by turning the key, the key pushes you away, so you usually use it with one hand and hold it with the other hand to gain stability, unless they use a foot restraint to keep it from flying away
        - tools must never be left without attachment, they are attached to the Equipment Tether suit (with carabiner)
        - due to the different sizes of sockets and screws, there are also adapters that are put on the key, the adapters are also connected to the smaller Equipment Theater (socket catty) with a plug so that they do not fly off when putting on

Brief characteristics of selected space suits
=============================================

Characteristics of the Sokol suit
---------------------------------

Characteristics of the Orlan MKS suit
-------------------------------------
.. todo::
    - 5.7 PSI

Characteristics of the ACES i MACES suit
----------------------------------------
.. todo:: The Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) or "pumpkin suit" :cite:`AstronautTrainingJournals2005`, was a full pressure suit that began to be worn by Space Shuttle crews after STS-65, for the ascent and entry portions of flight. The suit is a direct descendant of the U.S. Air Force high-altitude pressure suits worn by the two-man crews of the SR-71 Blackbird, pilots of the U-2 and X-15, and Gemini pilot-astronauts, and the Launch Entry Suits (LES) worn by NASA astronauts starting on the STS-26 flight, the first flight after the Challenger disaster. The suit is manufactured by the David Clark Company of Worcester, Massachusetts. Cosmetically the suit is very similar to the LES. ACES was first used in 1994.

.. todo:: Underneath the suits, astronauts wear "Maximum Absorbency Garment" (MAGs) urine-containment trunks (resembling "Depends" incontinence shorts) and blue-colored thermal underwear, which has plastic tubing woven into the garments allowing for liquid cooling and ventilation, the latter being handled by a connector located on the astronaut's left waist.

.. todo:: MACES (Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit) is a work in progress. It is a suit intended for use in Orion. Because of mass and volume constraints, NASA wanted to be able to use ACES (the suit intended for ascent and entry during Space Shuttle missions) both for ascent/entry periods of Orion missions and also for EVA (space walks). MACES, therefore, is a hybrid of the orange Space Shuttle escape suit and the white ISS EVA suit.

.. todo:: The suit has a new cooling garment and new bearings in the joints. It also uses the gloves and boots from the ISS EVA suit (EMU). It looks like it will be suitable for EVAs up to about four hours. And, since that is a much longer period that the crew have to keep the visor closed while in the vehicle, a drink bag has also been added.

.. todo:: Initially, ACES was intended to be retired after the Space Shuttle Program and be replaced by the Constellation Space Suit :cite:`STSTransitionAndRetirement`. The Orion missions are now instead planned to use a modified ACES (MACES). This suit would have increased mobility in comparison to its Space Shuttle counterpart and would use a closed-loop system to preserve resources :cite:`Zero-Gravity-Suit-Tests`. NASA is also considering using it for contingency and possibly limited capacity EVAs, such as those carried out during the Gemini program :cite:`Gohmert2013`. Simulated microgravity testing has occurred on parabolic flights and in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, in order to better characterise the suit's mobility :cite:`Gohmert2013` :cite:`Zero-Gravity-Suit-Tests`.

        - They sit under water after 6 hours and it is very exhausting for their hands
        - Why are space suits still bulky? While it's technically possible to create a tight suit that protects you from the vacuum of space and probably the extreme temperatures as well, one of the functions of the suit is to protect you from meteoroids -- grains of sand moving at tens of thousands of miles per hour. For this reason, the suit is made up of many layers of different fabrics that will stop a meteoroid from puncturing the suit -- and the astronaut. As you can see in this diagram, layers 6 through 14, 9 layers in total, are devoted to stopping meteoroids.
    - Pool-specific procedures
        - weight out - divers balance the astronaut - they add foam and weights to keep you neutral in every position: vertically, upside down, sideways

        - sharp edges
        - live equipment
        - information what not to touch
        - information on what not to connect to
    - Ground IV informs about the next steps for EV1 and EV2
    - portable foot restraint installation, before proceeding with further steps such as unscrewing

EVA on the surface of the planets
---------------------------------

EVA on the surface of asteroids and low gravity moons
-----------------------------------------------------
Currently, NASA is conducting research on the execution of EVA on the surface of asteroids and moons with low gravitational pull. The two main targets where such procedures would apply are the celestial bodies under the canceled * Asteroid Redirect Mission * program and the surface of Deimos and Phobos, the moons of the planet Mars.

Landing on the surface of natural Mars satellites has the advantages of extremely low gravity. Astronauts, after one year of flying from Earth, could test the systems and procedures on these small celestial bodies, and one concept is to build a settlement at this point in the first place before landing on the "red planet". Due to the very low gravitational pull.

NASA is currently evaluating harpoon systems and nets on which astronauts could navigate, due to the fact that a stronger jump can "launch" an astronaut for several dozen minutes into space before it subsides and can continue to move.
