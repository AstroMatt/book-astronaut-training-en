    "notes": "Kincheloe was the original USAF project pilot for the X-15. He placed well ahead of his contemporaries in training for the X-15. Some space officials considered him to have a lock on being the first man on the moon, although his height (6' 1\") may have prevented him from getting into the Apollo program. On 7 September 1956, Kincheloe piloted the X-2 to a record 126,200 feet (38,491 m).",
