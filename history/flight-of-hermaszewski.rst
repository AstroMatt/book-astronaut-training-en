General Hermaszewski flight
===========================

The Soyuz-30 flight took place on June 27 - July 5, 1978. The main crew consisted of the following team: Mirosław Hermaszewski and Piotr Iljicz Klimuk (:numref:`figure-soyuz-30-crew`). The reserve team included Valery Nikolaevich Kubasov and Zenon Jankowski.

The main task of Soyuz-30 was docking to the Salut-6 station and carrying out scientific and biomedical research listed in :numref:`table-soyuz-30-experiments` for research units, :cite:`Hermaszewski2013`:

- Military Institute of Aviation Medicine (WIML),
- Institute of Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences,
- Institute of Geodesy and Cartography (IGiK),
- Space Research Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences (CBK),
- for foreign research units under the Intercosmos agreement.

The mission was successful and the assumed tasks were completed. :numref:`table-soyuz-30-timeline` presents a list of the most important events during the Soyuz-30 flight.

As part of the training for the mission, cosmonauts underwent training, including:

- sea rescue and landing in the aquatic environment,
- getting to know the microgravity environment during the parabolic flight of the TU-104A plane,
- psychological and fitness tests,
- training in navigation and dynamics of orbital flight,
- training of the labyrinthine apparatus on the Barani's chair,
- body performance tests on a cycloergometer,
- Soyuz-30 flight and docking maneuvers simulations :numref:`figure-soyuz-30-simulator`,
- medical and fitness research.

With the exception of EVA and ISS robotic and special systems training, the process of preparing cosmonauts for the Soyuz-30 flight was similar to the training process for long-term space flights to the International Space Station.

To commemorate the flight of the first Pole, the crew took the flag and the national emblem on board (:numref:`figure-soyuz-30-onboard`). General Hermaszewski is currently the only Pole in space. Training for the mission, flight details, the scope of research carried out in orbit as well as the events after returning from the mission can be read in the study by General Hermaszewski entitled "The Burden of Weightlessness" :cite:`Hermaszewski2013`.
