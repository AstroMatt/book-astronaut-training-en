The space race and a brief history of manned spaceflight
========================================================

After the Second World War, the arms race turned into the so-called the Cold War between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The official date of start of the * Space Race * is August 2, 1955. On that day, the Soviet Union responded to the declaration announced by the US government four days earlier of its intention to launch an artificial satellite on the occasion of the international year of geophysics :cite:`Cadbury2006`.

Launched on October 4, 1957, the USSR's Sputnik became the first artificial Earth satellite. This event marked the beginning of a series of successes for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in space, which included:

- the first launch of the animal (dog named Łajka, October 3, 1957),
- the first unmanned landing on the moon (Luna 2, September 13, 1959) :cite:`Shelton1969`,
- launching and orbiting the first man (J. Gagarin, April 12, 1961),
- the first orbital flight lasting over a day (G. Titow, August 6, 1961),
- the first woman in space (W. Tereshkowa, June 16, 1963),
- the first space walk (A. Leonow, March 18, 1965),
- the first animals orbiting the Moon which return to Earth (Zond 5, September 15, 1968) :cite:`Siddiqi2000`.

The first animal to cross the border line of space was Łajka dog launched with the Sputnik 8K71PS rocket in a Sputnik-2 capsule :cite:`Siddiqi2000`. Due to the high temperature caused by damage and incomplete disconnection of the rocket segment from the satellite, the animal died a few hours after the launch. The dog was scheduled to live in orbit for 10 days. After 162 days (about 2,000 orbits), the capsule with the dead body entered the atmosphere and burned :cite:`Harford1997`.

The first man in space was Major Yuri Gagarin (later promoted to colonel). Gagarin was one of 20 people who were selected among the military pilots of the Soviet Union. Major was distinguished with endurance, spirit and experience :cite:`Siddiqi2000`. Gagarin was launched by the Soviet Union on April 12, 1961 in a 108-minute orbital flight around the Earth aboard the Vostok-1. After circling the Earth, it re-entered the atmosphere according to the so-called a ballistic curve which is characterized by a high level of overloads acting on the astronaut's body. Due to the fact that Soviet designers did not yet have the technique to safely land the spacecraft on the ground, it was decided to use a catapult chair and a parachute. At 20,000 feet above sea level (about 6,000 meters), Gagarin catapulted from the capsule and, using a parachute, landed safely in the territory of the USSR :cite:`Why-Yuri-Gagarin-Remains-the-First-Man-in-Space`.

The American response to the plan to send man into space was the Mercury program. During the selection process, seven astronauts were selected for the program. On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to fly into space. September 12, 1962. six months after Shepard's flight, President of the United States of America J. F. Kennedy gave a speech at Rice University in which he mobilized the nation and set the goal of "by the end of the decade, man would set foot on the moon and return safely to Earth." :cite:`Kennedy1962`. This goal was achieved in 1969, when the American astronaut Neil Armstrong stood on the natural satellite of the Earth. The most important American programs are:

- Mercury project,
- Gemini project,
- Apollo project,
- Skylab project (Apollo Application),
- Space Shuttle program,
- participation in the ISS program.

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was a leader in space topics, and until the first steps of Neil Armstrong, Soviet technology was considered dominant. The manned programs of the USSR were characterized by great complexity and diversity. The most important programs of the USSR and later Russian Federation include:

- Wostok program,
- Woschod program,
- Sojuz and Progress program,
- Moon program (N1-L3),
- Salut program,
- Interkosmos program,
- Buran program,
- Mir space station,
- participation in the ISS program.

Due to the current plan of human return to the Moon, it is worth taking a closer look at the Apollo and N1-L3 programs. As part of these missions and the entire cycle of preparation for flights, mechanisms, procedures, training and research infrastructure have been created. Some of the technologies and developments that allowed man to stand on the lunar surface in 1969 are still relevant and can be used in the training of astronauts for future missions to other celestial bodies.
