Skylab Program
==============

The main focus of subsequent NASA programs was to development of * LEO - Low Earth Orbit *. During the last missions of the Apollo program, the Apollo Applications Program (AAP) was established, the purpose of which was to create a plan to use technologies produced for the needs of lunar missions in further space exploration :cite:`Ertel2007`. The first major program to implement the new strategy was Skylab (1973-1979). Its main assumption was the construction of a space station and the test of the impact of long-term stay in space on the human body. The Skylab program inherited the Saturn V rockets, which were used not only to carry the construction elements into orbit, but also after the transformation of the upper stage of the rocket, formed the basis for the construction of the station. Astronauts to Skylab were carried out in the Apollo Command / Service Module (CSM) created for the implementation of the Apollo program and manned missions to the Moon.

The most important achievements of the Skylab program include:

- development of space walk technology and procedures (* EVA *),
- refining the design of the space suit,
- study of the long-term influence of microgravity environment on the human body,
- observation of the Sun with a multispectral solar observatory (* Apollo Telescope Mount *),
- refining the design of docking ports,
- development of air lock technology,
- the first controlled deorbitation of a large structure.
