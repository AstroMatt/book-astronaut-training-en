Vostok was the first manned space program in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The highlight of the program was the flight of the Soviet major Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961 - the first man in space. During the program from 1961 to 1963, there were 6 manned flights, and the longest lasted 5 days. The last four flights were fired in pairs one day apart.
