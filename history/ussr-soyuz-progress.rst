Sojuz/Progress program
======================

The Soyuz program is one of the longest running space programs. It was a direct successor to the Woschod program and started in the mid-1960s. Originally, the goal of the program was to lay the foundations for lunar flight, but later the requirements were changed.

The Soyuz program with subsequent modifications continues to this day. The Soyuz rocket and capsule is the most reliable spacecraft. Since the decommissioning of US shuttles, Soyuz has been the only mode of transport to and from the International Space Station. The situation was changed with the creation of the Dragon spacecraft from SpaceX. More about the program in the chapter on :ref:`training in pilotage of Sojuz <Pilot training>`.

Simultaneously with the Soyuz crew capsule, its unmanned Progress version was created. Like the Soyuz, Progress is still in use and source of supply for the ISS.
