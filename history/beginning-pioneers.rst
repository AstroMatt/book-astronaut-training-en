Pioneers of cosmonautics
========================

The rocket era began with the publication of the so-called Ciołkowski's formula defining the speed of a rocket that
changes mass (consumes fuel during flight). This formula was published in the book "Exploring the space of the world
with jet devices" :cite:`Ciolkowski1967`. For the first pioneers of cosmonautics using the theoretical foundations
created by Ciołkowski are:

- dr Robert H. Goddard (USA),
- Siergiej Korolew (ZSRR),
- Hermann Oberth (Germany),
- Robert Albert Charles Esnault-Pelterie (France).

The above-mentioned scientists and engineers conducted research on propellants, solid and liquid fuels and rocket
aerodynamics. On March 16, 1926, Robert H. Goddard successfully launched the world's first liquid-fuel rocket
:cite:`Goddard-American-Rocketry-Pioneer`.

During World War II, a lot of research was carried out using liquid fuel. The Werner von Braun rocket
"Vergeltungswaffe 2" known as the V-2 was the world's first long-range missile. Mainly used as a weapon to bomb the
Allied cities, it was also used for the test to aswer it was possible to cross the Karman Line, i.e. reach outer space,
for the first time.
