Apollo Program
==============

The most ambitious program in the history of astronautics was the Apollo program. In less than a decade, it has been possible to develop technology and procedures that allow humans to stand on the surface of the moon and safely return to Earth. The Apollo program was an attempt to implement the declaration of the US President J. F. Kennedy from September 12, 1962 :cite:`Kennedy1962`.

Each of the Apollo missions had a different task depending on the category to which it was assigned :cite:`Ertel2007`. :numref:`table-apollo-mission-types` presents the types of missions and a description of each of the categories.

Brief characteristics of the Apollo mission:

- Apollo 1 - fire during routine test, crew died,
- Apollo 7 - the first launch of the Saturn V rocket with astronauts in the * Command Module * :cite:`Eisele2017`, :cite:`Cunningham2010`,
- Apollo 8 - the first orbit of the Moon, the iconic photo of the Earth sunrise (* Lunar Earthrise *),
- Apollo 10 - full test for * G * missions, 8.4 NM (15.6 km) distance to the Moon surface,
- Apollo 11 - first moon landing,
- Apollo 12 - the most accurate landing in the Apollo program, taking over the camera of the Surveyor 3 lander, which landed two years earlier (April 20, 1967),
- Apollo 13 - the explosion of the oxygen tank and a dramatic fight against time to bring the crew back to Earth,
- Apollo 14 - the oldest astronaut on the moon, the first game of golf on the Moon surface,
- Apollo 15 - the first use of the vehicle on the surface of the Moon,
- Apollo 16 - the first three-day mission on the Moon (type * J *)
- Apollo 17 - the last landing on the Moon (the first mission in which the scientist - geologist took part), the iconic photo of the Earth from a distance (* Blue Marble *) :cite:`Cernan2000`,
- Apollo-Soyuz Test Project - the last mission of the program, during which the Apollo and Soyuz ships were docked in orbit and a historical handshake between representatives of two powers took place.
