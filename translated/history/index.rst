History of astronautics
=======================


So far, space programs have been conducted mainly by two countries USA and the
Russian Federation (formerly the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics). The
USSR was the initiator of international cooperation. As part of the Intercosmos
program, the first cosmonauts who were not citizens of the above-mentioned
powers flew, and General Hermaszewski became the first Pole to do so.

During the selection, cosmonauts and astronauts were selected mainly due to
their experience in piloting, although there were also groups of people from
other specialties, such as engineering, science, medicine as well as teachers.

Along with the technological development allowing for the autonomous flying
and docking of spacecraft, and with the increasing number of launches,
increasing the stability and safety of flights and stays in space, the
emphasis on the candidate's pilot experience decreases. Although pilots
are still highly valued specialists, the amount of research, its complexity
and specificity promotes the profile of candidates with science or engineering
education. At the same time, it is worth noting that in most assignments to
missions, people who went into space were trained to conduct research outside
the scope of their specialization, which strongly promotes versatile people.

On the basis of the dominant features among astronauts of the analyzed programs
within the proposed goal of work, candidates should be multidisciplinary, able
to work in a group and conduct research beyond the scope of specialization,
because these elements dominated in the selection, training and carrying out
missions.

Below is a compilation of the largest astronautics and space programs of the
US and the Russian Federation (former USSR).
