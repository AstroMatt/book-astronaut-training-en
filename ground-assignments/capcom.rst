Work as a Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)
=======================================

A large part of the tasks of an astronaut on Earth is working as a mission controller communicating with the crew (* CAPCOM - Capsule Communicator *). This Mission Control Center (* MCC) position is reserved for the sole contact with astronauts in orbit. CAPCOM was introduced to reduce communication chaos and the amount of contradictory information that reaches the crew. Traditionally, since the Mercury program, only the astronaut has played this role in mission control structures, as "only an astronaut with the same training and experience is best able to communicate in a crisis situation." :cite:`Wolfe1979`.

An example of good communication and effective use of the crew's experience can be the work of astronauts of the European Space Agency during the EVA, which took place in January 2017. During this event, astronaut Luca Parmitano assisted Thomas Pesquet in completing his tasks, and thus managed to achieve all the set goals for this EVA well ahead of time.

Participation in the role of CAPCOM requires constant contact with the crew in space. However, in order to prepare astronauts for specific language, mental abbreviations and acronyms used in manned flights, it is possible to use the infrastructure currently existing in the country.
