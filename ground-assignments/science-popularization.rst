Popularization of science and the area of S.T.E.M.
==================================================

Astronauts are recognizable public figures who most strongly represent space agencies and therefore become their ambassadors. One of the most important and time-consuming tasks of astronauts during their stay on Earth is to popularize science within the S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). Members of the mission speak publicly at conferences, technology picnics, and schools, raising awareness of the use of items developed for the space industry that have found their way into everyday use. In addition, their tasks also include justifying high money spending by space agencies on research and development projects :cite:`Massimino2016`.
