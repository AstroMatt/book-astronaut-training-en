Equipment testing and assistance in the development of new engineering solutions
================================================================================

Due to the extensive training and experience gained in orbit, astronauts who returned from a mission and were not assigned to the next one usually test the equipment. Thanks to their suggestions and expertise, space agencies are able to prepare further ventures even better. Some of the common tasks belonging to astronauts include:

- testing new tools used during space walks,
- testing rovers and vehicles for use on other planets,
- work on creating and testing new space suits for both IVA and EVA applications,
- participation in the development of fixes and improvements to the modules of the International Space Station,
- testing new systems, trainers and simulators.

An example of the latter is the Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen, who, being a CF-18 pilot by profession, underwent another intensive aviation training at the Flight Research Laboratory, NRC, Canada. Where he learned to fly a modified version of the Bell 205 helicopter transformed into a lunar lander simulator. The development of this solution will allow the machine to be used in the training of future astronauts whose task will be to return to the Moon or landing on Mars.:cite:`CSAAstronautsFAQ`.

There are many organizations in Poland, such as the Air Force Institute of Technology (ITWL), which conduct research on innovative aviation solutions. As part of strengthening cooperation with space agencies, this center could be a primary place for testing new solutions and developing innovative systems simulating a Moon or Mars landing, as well as extraterrestrial movement and navigation.
