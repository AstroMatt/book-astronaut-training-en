* Ground Assignments * is the astronaut's time between missions, which is used both for training to maintain skills, training other astronauts, helping to develop new engineering solutions, creating operational procedures and EVA choreography, testing new simulators and robots solutions as well as to popularize science and space exploration :cite:`ESAAstronautsGroundAssignments`.

In addition, astronauts visit various private agencies such as SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and Scaled Composites to strengthen cooperation. They also take part in scientific research and the development of technology for future missions.

Experienced astronauts take part in:

- selection of new candidates,
- selection of astronauts flying to the ISS,
- planning the scope of training,
- certification of flying personnel,
- support for missions currently underway,
- emergency aid in restoring astronauts to fitness after flight,
- long-term rehabilitation of returning astronauts,
- reintegration of the crew returning with the rest of the astronauts,
- cooperation with international partners.

The following chapters present selected astronaut ground assignments.
