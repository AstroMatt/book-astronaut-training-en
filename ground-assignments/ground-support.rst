Work in simulators in case of problems in orbit
===============================================

Solving emergencies in orbit requires many trials in simulators. During the Apollo 13 mission, the * backup crew * participated in many hours of attempts to optimize the use of the Command and Service Module systems as well as the Lunar Module. During the testing of the systems, an attempt was made to select and disable devices other than those that were absolutely necessary for the proper functioning of the vehicle. Thanks to the simulations, it was possible to reduce the consumption of electricity and to leave a reserve so that the landing parachute release system could work efficiently, bringing astronauts safely to the ocean on Earth.

The construction of simulators will also allow the topic of solving problems in orbit to be developed. Astronauts stationed in Poland could conduct simulations affecting the security of the mission as well as simulating various alternative paths of performing operational procedures in order to select the most optimal solution.
