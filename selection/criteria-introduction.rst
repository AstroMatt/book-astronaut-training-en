Criteria for selecting candidates
=================================
The process of basic astronaut training takes about two years. Due to the large number of people and resources involved in training the candidate, this cycle is very expensive. The support required to prepare for and after a mission is enormous. For this reason, space agencies select the most qualified people for this position. Years of work by many teams of professionals are required to prepare a space mission. And although the position of the astronaut is one of the most prestigious and desired in the world, their success is built by teams of instructors, trainers, engineers and technicians remaining on Earth :cite:`How-to-Become-an-ESA-Astronaut`.

The limited possibilities and cost of sending humans into space require a careful selection of candidates. For this reason, the process of selecting astronauts and cosmonauts is a difficult task. It requires multidisciplinary skills and a high level of assimilation of knowledge in many scientific and operational fields from applicants. The following chapter presents the criteria and the process of selecting the best candidates. :numref:`table-astronaut-requirements` presents a summary of the minimum skills and desirable characteristics of candidates for astronauts in various space agencies.
