    Ability to parse and solve complex problems rapidly with incomplete information in a hostile environment, this is what makes you an astronaut. Astronaut is a person who can quickly without complete information make a decision when decisions can mean life or death.

    Astronauts are overachievers and some astronauts go on to very eclectic things. One of the most interesting astronauts is Story Musgrave. He was an active astronaut for over 30 years and holds the distinction of being the only astronaut to fly on all five space shuttles. While he was an astronaut he obtained 7 graduate degrees – math, computers, chemistry, medicine, physiology, literature, and psychology. In his spare time he was a trauma surgeon, pilot, and parachutist. Today he operates a palm farm in Florida, a production company in Australia, and a sculpture company in California. He is a landscape architect. He has worked for Walt Disney's Imagineering team as a concept artist. He teaches design at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. And he's a public speaker with 20 honorary doctorates.

Preparing astronauts and cosmonauts for long-term space missions begins with the selection of candidates for basic training. At the moment, people are most often recruited among the most desirable professions, i.e .:

- the pilot, and in particular the test pilot,
- doctor,
- engineer,
- scientist (in the field of natural sciences).

The choice of a candidate is also influenced by experience, education, flight hours as well as completed courses and survival expeditions. Astronauts are also public figures who often appear in front of large gatherings, therefore the ability to use social media, write texts and speak is highly valued.:cite:`How-to-Become-an-ESA-Astronaut`. English and Russian are now officially spoken on the International Space Station (ISS), therefore candidates are also required to know one of the above. The ability to communicate in both languages is welcome. Additionally, due to the international nature of space missions, it is desirable to be interested in the culture of the European, United States, Japan and Russia.

People taking part in the recruitment are subjected to meticulous research aimed at selecting the best candidates. During the research, factors such as listed below are taken into consideration: :cite:`Psychological-and-medical-selection-process`, :cite:`Health-and-physical-condition`, :cite:`Qualifications-and-skills-required`:

- physical condition and efficiency of the body,
- the ability to adapt to changing conditions,
- mental stability,
- resistance to stress,
- ability to act under pressure,
- ability to follow procedures,
- psychomotor activity,
- overload resistance,
- the ability to associate and predict.
