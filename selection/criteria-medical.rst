Medical selection
-----------------
Health of the candidate is one of the most important selection criteria. Recruited people must demonstrate remarkable adaptation to the conditions of weightlessness. This is mainly due to the enormous cost of training astronauts and the desire to reduce the possibility of problems during the mission due to the health of the working operator. The efficiency of the motor system, circulation and balance is of great importance for the candidate's future work.

In addition, hight is also one of the key indicators. Due to the lower distance between the heart and the brain, shorter people are more predisposed to withstand greater overloads. Apart from the predisposition itself for medical reasons, hight is also important for the construction of spacecraft. For example the Russian Soyuz TMA ship which deliver astronauts to the International Space Station is intended for people with an hight in the range of 150 to 190 cm :cite:`ISS-Spacecraft-Soyuz-TM` (TM versions before June 1999 were limited from 164 to 182 cm). For the same reason, applicants between 62 and 75 inches tall are admitted to the US Astronaut Corps :cite:`NASA-Astronaut-Requirements` which corresponds to 157.5 and 190.5 cm. The requirement of the European Space Agency in this area is a height between 153 and 190 cm :cite:`ESA-Astronaut-Training-Requirements`. :numref:`table-soyuz-requirements` presents a list of anthropometric parameters for candidates for astronauts.

The above parameters are verified during medical research in the astronaut selection process using :cite:`ESA-Astronaut-Training-Requirements`:

- Rhine wheel,
- swivel chairs,
- pressure chambers,
- centrifuges,
- flights in a non-gravity environment.

In addition, during operational training, astronauts fly supersonic planes, so they must have medical skills at the level of a military pilot. The research includes:

- Chest X-ray,
- pantomogram,
- X-ray of the sinuses,
- Abdominal ultrasound,
- exercise test on the treadmill,
- analysis of the Holter examination record,
- echo of the heart,
- EEG recording analysis,
- ENG analysis and the equilibrium system response to labyrinth stimulation,
- spirometry,
- ECG recording,
- ophthalmological examination,
- internal medicine examination,
- neurological examination,
- orthopedic examination,
- ENT examination,
- audiogram and hearing control,
- anthropometric measurements,
- Low Pressure Chamber test,
- magnetic resonance imaging,
- dental examination,
- test in an overload centrifuge.
