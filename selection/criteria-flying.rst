Selection due to flight experience
----------------------------------
Flying experience is not required for applicants not applying for the role of pilot-astronaut, but is highly desirable:cite:`ESA-Astronaut-Training-Requirements`.

The pilot-astronaut during the mission specializes in the management of spacecraft. Historically, at the US NASA, mission commanders were pilots. His duties include pilotage, responsibility for the crew and the success of the mission, and taking care of safety on board. In addition, there were two pilots on the Space Shuttle flights:

- Commander (spaceship commander),
- Pilot (first officer).

The pilot (similarly to first officer) supports the commander in controlling the ship.

In the times of orbital flights, using the Soyuz spaceship, which for political reasons can only be piloted by a Russian cosmonaut, the role of a pilot in other agencies turned into the so-called an * Flight Engineer * analogous to the * Mission Specialist * of the STS era. Currently, the role of a pilot may extend to the scope of duties related to the capture and deployment of satellites, the use of a robotic arm - manipulator, EVA and cargo operations, therefore the requirements are similar to those of people from other environments :cite:`NASA-Astronaut-Requirements`.

When specializing as a pilot-astronaut, the US NASA requires 1,000 hours of flight time as pilot-in-command (* PIC) on jet aircraft :cite:`NASA-Astronaut-Requirements`. In this case, people with test pilot experience are preferred.

The requirements due to seeing ability for pilots are increased:

- 20/100 in far vision, preferred without correction (glasses, lenses),
- 20/20 in vision with correction.

Increased hight criteria:

- Minimum 58.5 inches (148.59 cm)
- Maximum 76 inches (193.04 cm)
