Psychological selection
-----------------------
One of the key elements taken into account in selection is resistance to stress and the ability to act under pressure. The astronaut as an operator must be able to carry out the given activities regardless of the circumstances. Following the procedures in the case of various types of failures and exceptional events is absolutely essential. These procedures have been prepared through years of practice and any deviation may endanger crew members or death. The ability to assess the situation and think critically is also required.

In addition, the feature of working in space conditions is being in small, windowless rooms (with the exception of viewpoints) in a rarely changing company. Candidates must be able to coexist in an international environment, conduct research and interaction, and communicate. Mental stability, non-bias and emotional maturity are required from candidates :cite:`French2007`. In order to describe people incapable of operating in the above-mentioned conditions, attempts are made to close them in the Personal Rescue Enclosure and isolate them.

One of the key elements of astronaut training is staying in various training centers around the world. It is associated with a long stay away from home and constant separation from the family. The stay on the International Space Station itself usually lasts about six months. These times will definitely be extended due to the need to prepare for long-term space missions to the Moon and Mars. Future missions will take longer and longer :cite:`Kelly2017`, :cite:`Massimino2016`.

In addition, a lot of attention is paid to :cite:`ESA-Astronaut-Training-Requirements`:

- reasoning ability,
- good memory,
- concentration,
- manual dexterity,
- the ability to adapt to changing spatial conditions.

The perfect candidate has :cite:`ESA-Astronaut-Training-Requirements`:

- high motivation,
- flexibility,
- sociability,
- empathy,
- low level of aggression,
- emotional stability,
- the ability to long-term cooperation in an intercultural environment,
- multidisciplinarity.

The preliminary research process is carried out by a team of qualified specialists in the field of psychology. The final step in the selection process is an interview with the panel of experts. Among the questions asked by members of the commission, there are those that arise most frequently during recruitment :cite:`Hadfield2013`, :cite:`Hermaszewski2013`, :cite:`Anderson2015`, :cite:`Massimino2016`, :cite:`Wolfe1979`, :cite:`Melvin2017`

- why do you want to become an astronaut?
- describe your strengths and how you use them,
- describe your weaknesses and how you work on them,
- what is the application of your experience?
- do you have good situational awareness and judgment?
- how well are you communicating?
- are you a team player?
- do you show initiative in a group?
- are you a person who is dedicated to work?
- what is the balance between your humility and ego?
- can you repair things (car, tap, toilet)?
- what are your operational skills?
- how quickly do you adapt to the new environment and people?
- how do you cope with constant change?
- don't you have an overly intense (overbearing) personality?
- don't you focus too much on details?

Many candidates follow the usual pattern. Space agencies are looking for people who are innovative and can stand out from the group. Lack of skills in acquiring EVA, robotics or using a foreign language causes the candidate's immediate disqualification.

The ideal candidate should show:

- how consistently he tries to increase his skills,
- how he tries to be better,
- awares of what features are required for an astronaut,
- is not afraid to try new things,
- how efficiently he works during stress,
- can make decisions quickly when the consequences may result in death,
- healthy ego (lack of conceit).

All licenses, training, education, studies etc. must be completed by the application end date. Unfinished items are not assessed during the selection :cite:`Massimino2016`. Individual interviews are conducted by current astronauts and high-level managers of the relevant organizational units of space agencies. Selected candidates must be approved by the directors of space agencies.

The above questions are only a representative example of the issues raised during the interview and are intended to represent the behavior and thinking of the candidate. The Commission must also be convinced that the candidate will be a good representative of the space agency for many years to come. The whole conversation of the person applying for the position of astronaut comes down to the basic and most important question that is usually answered by the leader of the commission, the senior astronaut:

- Would I like to go into space with this person?
