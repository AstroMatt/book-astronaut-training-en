Roscosmos (Russian Federation)
------------------------------
Until the end of 2015, the space agency Roscosmos was subordinate to the military structures of the Russian Federation and before that to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. For this reason, candidates for cosmonauts were selected among Air Force officers and military pilots. With the organizational changes of December 31, 2015, Roscosmos has transformed into a civilian agency managed like the American NASA :cite:`Cosmonauts-Biographical-Data`. For this reason, the astronaut recruitment process has changed and in the coming years there will be more civilians among Russian cosmonauts, especially scientists and engineers. It is worth mentioning, that in 2021 Roscosmos sent to the International Space Station civilian filmmakers (director and actress), appropriately trained for that mission. The goal of their mission was to make the first feature movie in space.
