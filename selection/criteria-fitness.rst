Fitness selection
-----------------
The nature of an astronaut's work requires high physical activity and high physical fitness. During many months, and ultimately many years, space missions to counteract the dangerous effects of the lack of gravity on the skeletal system and muscle atrophy, astronauts must exercise at least two hours a day.

Candidates who take part in the recruitment must be able to withstand the set loads and high physical effort. These skills require many years of fitness and endurance preparation and are assessed by a recruitment committee.

During recruitment, they are assessed, among others :cite:`CSAAstronautsFAQ`:

- swimming skills (250m swim in 10 minutes),
- ability to float on the surface of the water without using your hands (* tread water *) 10 minutes,
- the ability to swim underwater (minimum 15m),
- running over the so-called an envelope,
- long-distance running with increasing tempo,
- weight lifting and upper body strength assessment.
