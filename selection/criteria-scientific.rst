Selection of technical and scientific skills
--------------------------------------------
One of the most crucial elements in the selection of candidates for astronauts and cosmonauts is selection based on skills and experience. Currently, agencies are moving away from astronaut specialization :cite:`Hadfield2013`, :cite:`Anderson2015` and each crew member must be familiar with all aspects of working in orbit, such as piloting spacecraft, conducting scientific research, providing medical assistance and carrying out operational tasks, manipulating robotic arms and making space walks. The astronaut becomes an operator, i.e. a highly qualified specialist in performing carefully planned and overtrained activities. It requires great versatility from the candidate and the ability to adapt to changing conditions.

Different levels of education are required depending on the space agency. The US NASA only requires undergraduate studies at the bachelor's / engineering level in the terms of natural sciences and engineering. The European ESA requires at least a Master's degree and highly values the completion of the Aeronautics and Astronautics specialization. A candidate who remains only on the minimum level has little chance of being selected. Space agencies prefer specialists and academics with an * PhD * degree.

In the case of medical doctors, professional experience and specialization profile are taken into account. Depending on the research carried out, medical doctors with the following specializations have the chances of choosing:

- radiologist,
- orthopaedist,
- cardiologist / vascular (* cardiovascular *) surgeon,
- oculist.
