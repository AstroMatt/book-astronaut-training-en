-----------------------------------------------------------
The US space agency NASA organizes recruitment for the astronaut candidate (* ASCAN - Astronaut Candidate *) regularly every two years. The last recruitment of this type took place at the turn of 2020/2021 and ended on December, 2021 :cite:`NASA-Astronaut-Selection-Proces`. A record number of people submitted their applications thanks to the involvement of social media and other mass media. The admissions committee had to process almost 20,000 applications and select the top 10 applicants to begin preparation and basic training :cite:`NASA-Astronaut-Selection`.

The classes of astronauts, like the teams assigned to the mission, form the so-called * class patch *. Each group of candidates has its own unique name, which is given by the preceding selection :cite:`Anderson2015`, :cite:`Inactive-NASA-Astronauts`.
