Anti-G score, defined as the G-load x running time to the endpoint, was significantly higher in the exercise trials than standing trials. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), thoracic fluid index (TFI) were significantly superior during the exercise trials. Artificial gravity by centrifuge at 1.2 or 1.4 G with 40 or 60 W of ergometric workload may be an excellent countermeasure against cardiovascular deconditioning after long exposure to microgravity.},
