The Outer Space Treaty
----------------------
- 1967
- principals governing the activities of States in exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies
- As of July 2017

    - 107 countries are parties to the treaty
    - 23 signed but not ratified

- Key points:

    - bars States from placing weapons of mass destruction in orbit around Earth, installing them on the Moon or any other celestial body, or otherwise stationing them in outer space
    - exclusively limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes
    - expressly prohibits their use for testing wapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers or establishing military bases, installations and fortifications
    - does not prohibit the placement of conventional wapons in orbit and some highly destructive attack strategies are still potentially allowed
    - states that the exploration of outer space shall be done to benefit all countries
    - that space shall be free for exploration and use by all States
    - forbids any government from claiming a celestial resource such as the Moon or a planet.
    - Article II states that "POuter space, inclusing the Moon and other celestial bodies. is not subject to national appropriation by clain of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means"
    - The State that launches a space object retains jurisdiction and control over that object.
    - The State is also liable for damages cause by their space object.

Space Debris
------------
- Problem at LEO
- Problem at GEO (Geostationary orbit over equator)

Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty addresses the legal base for debris mitigation and ADR:

    - ADR - Active Debris Removal
    - States parties to the Treaty shall be guided by the principle of cooperation and mutual assistance and shall conduct all their activities in outer space with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other States parties to the Treaty
    - States parties to the Treaty shall pursue studies of outer space, ... and conduct space exploration so as *to avoid harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the inroduction of extraterrestial matter and, where necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this purpose."

Measures in place for mitigation of the space debris problem:

    - De-orbiting of a satellite at end of life (25-year post operational life limit).
    - De-orbiting of lanucher upper stages reaching orbit status
    - ADR techniquest development is actively pursued by several Agencies and Institutions (e.g ESA's Clean Space Initiative, RemoveDebris of the Surrey Space Centre, CleanSpaceOne at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, etc.)

The Moon Treaty
---------------
- 1979
- Ipplies to the Moon and other celestial bodies in the solar system excluding the Earth.
- It stipulates that these bodies shoud be used exclusively for peaceful purposes, that their environments shod not be disrupted, and that the United Nations shoud be informed of the location and purpose of any station established on these bodies.
- The most controversial section of the Moon Treaty deals with natural resources on the Moon (or other celestial body). The Moon Treaty stipulates that the Moon and its natural resources are the common heritage of mankind and the harvesting of those resources is forbidden except through an international regime.
- The Moon Treaty is in fact a failed Treaty because it has not been ratified by most States that engaged in human space exploration (the USA, Canada, nearly all members of ESA, Russia, China and Japan). In November 2016, it had been ratified by 17 States.
