Astronaut training centers
==========================

Training of astronauts takes place, among others in specialized training centers. The scale and complexity of the training process requires the collaboration of multiple agencies. Currently, astronauts are trained through exchange programs in all training centers. Due to the US ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations), which defines the space and rocket industry as a weapon and prohibits cooperation with China, NASA astronauts do not receive training at ACC centers. Other countries cooperate and train each other astronauts in the field of their specialization. :numref:`table-infrastructure-training-centers` provides a list of training centers.

Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City, Moscow, Russia
------------------------------------------------------------
One of the oldest places where astronauts and cosmonauts are trained is the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center located in the Star City, 20 km northeast of Moscow. Currently, all  astronauts assigned to flights to the ISS on Soyuz spacecraft train at this facility. The center has a Hydro Lab neutral buoyancy pool and a set of simulators of the Russian ISS segments and the Soyuz spacecraft. CPK is the last training center before flight. Directly from there, the astronauts are transported to the Baikonur cosmodrome (also known as the Star City) where they undergo the last tests and preparations for the launch with the Soyuz rocket.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, USA
--------------------------------------
Historically, the Johnson Space Center (JSC) was the birthplace of the US space program. The Astronauts Office (building 4-S), the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (Sonny Carter Training Facility building) and the simulator of the American part of the ISS (building 29) are also located here. As in Star City, all the astronauts assigned to the ISS currently train at the JSC.

European Astronaut Centre, Cologne, Germany
-------------------------------------------
The European Astronaut Center (EAC) is a place where astronauts preparing to fly to the ISS receive training in the use of the Columbus module of the European Space Agency. The building is also home to European astronauts and training them. The EAC also houses the Neutral Buoyancy Facility, where astronauts can learn about the procedures and outfits for space walks. More in the chapter :ref:`concerning EVA training <EVA training>`.

Tsukuba Space Center, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan
---------------------------------------------
Tsukuba Space Center is a place where astronauts flying to the ISS receive training from the Japanese part of the station, i.e. the Kibo module and Japanese robotic systems. This building is also home to the JAXA astronauts

Astronaut Centre of China, Beijing, China
-----------------------------------------
The Chinese Astronaut Training Center (ACC) is located in Northeast Beijing :cite:`CNSAAstronautSelectionAndTraining`. It is the home of Chinese astronauts, and since China is not a country participating in the ISS program, there are no trainings here to prepare for flights to the ISS station. This is where the Chinese astronaut corps is trained and prepared for manned orbital missions under the Tiangong station program.

John H. Chapman Space Centre, Longueuil, QC, Canada
---------------------------------------------------
The John H. Chapman Space Center is home to the Canadian Space Agency and Canadian astronauts. At this facility, astronauts assigned to the ISS expedition receive training in the Canadarm 2 (SRMS - Shuttle Remote Manipulator System) robotic manipulator and Canadian experiments.
