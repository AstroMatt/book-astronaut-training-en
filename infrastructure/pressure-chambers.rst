Low pressure, vacuum and thermal chambers
=========================================

The use of low pressure chambers and * vacuum chambers * during training has its origins with the first prototypes of suits. Then they were used to check the tightness of the produced iterations of pressure clothes. Currently, the pressure chamber is used in training in four main ways:

- getting to know the symptoms of hypoxia (exercises without a suit),
- checking the tightness of the suit,
- training emergency suits procedures,
- to get acquainted with the environment of the lack of a gas medium.

Astronauts, just like pilots of stratospheric planes, ie U2, are trained in a suit inside pressure chambers. During the training, the trainee experiences a moment of sudden depressurization of the cabin at high altitude and the activation of the automatic life support system in the suit.

Thermal chambers
----------------
The * thermal chamber * is used to familiarize astronauts with the variable thermal environment outside the vehicle. During exercises in thermal chambers, the practitioner learns to regulate the temperature using the suit's air conditioning system.
