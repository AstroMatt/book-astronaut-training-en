Isolation experiments
=====================

Long-term stay in outer space with unchanging company influences a lot of complex psychological and sociodynamic processes. In particular, with planned missions on Mars or longer stays on the Moon, it is necessary to develop methods of early detection of mental problems and their more efficient solution. To this end, space organizations use the following methods:

- the use of isolation chambers (containers), i.e. Personal Rescue Enclosure (PRE),
- conducting isolation tests in medical research centers,
- use of long-term stays in habitats with the combination of exploration of the environment.

Personal Rescue Enclosure
-------------------------
Personal Rescue Enclosure devices were created for the needs of a prototype rescue system for Space Shuttle crews. They are shaped like a beach ball, 86 cm in diameter and 0.33 cubic meters in volume, and are constructed of Kevlar based material :cite:`Shayler2009`. Currently, they are used in the selection of astronauts to verify the absence of claustrophobia, darkness, time perception and isolation.

Isolation tests in medical centers
----------------------------------
The most famous study was the Mars-500 mission. During the 520-day isolation, the behavior of the crew on a simulated mission to Mars was checked. The research program ran between 2007 and 2011 and was led by the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences in cooperation with the European Space Agency.

Isolation tests in habitats
---------------------------
At the moment, there are few institutions in the world dealing with the subject of insulation research combined with exploration of the environment. Each of these facilities specializes in a specific and unique type of simulation. The habitats with possible stays of more than a week include:

- AATC, Poland,
- Lunares, Poland,
- HI-Seas, USA,
- MDRS, USA,
- FMARS, Canada,
- Aquarius, USA,
- HERA, USA.

AATC and Lunares habitats ware built by the the author of the work (Mateusz Harasymczuk), the habitats originator, Dr. Agata Ko≈Çodziejczyk with the participation of Space Garden company. In AATC habitat, research is conducted on:

- subjective perception of time,
- group dynamics and the impact of isolation on interpersonal relationships,
- habitat ergonomics,
- habitat architecture,
- a system of intelligent sensors,
- aquaponic and hydroponic systems,
- the use of physiological lamps in stimulating serotonin receptors,
- artificial control of the circadian rhythm,
- planning the work and schedule of astronauts,
- research on the closure of a semi-open life support system,
- use of resources available in the environment (* ISRU - In-Situ Resource Utilization *),
- the operating system of extraterrestrial habitats.
